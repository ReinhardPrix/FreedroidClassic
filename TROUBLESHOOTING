Q: My program responds with 'svgalib: Cannot get I/O permission.' and exits.
A: You are playing an ancient version of Freedroid, that used the SVGALIG for
   graphics output.  To play this ancient version, you need to be logged in as 
   root to play or you must set the permissions of the executable to suid root.
   This is no longer the case with more recent (e.g. those from 2003 or later)
   versions.

Q: I get bad performance (FPS very low!) with the game.
A: On very old hardware (like my 166Mhz Pentium 1 MMX machine) this is normal and
   can't be helped, cause FreedroidRPG has certain hardware requirements to give
   enjoyable game performance.  We hope to resolve these performance problems by
   switching to OpenGL based rendering in future versions of FreedroidRPG.
