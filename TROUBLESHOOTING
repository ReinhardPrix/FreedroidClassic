   -----------------------------------------------------

Q: My program responds with 'svgalib: Cannot get I/O permission.' and exits.
A: You are playing an ancient version of Freedroid, that used the SVGALIG for
   graphics output.  To play this ancient version, you need to be logged in as 
   root to play or you must set the permissions of the executable to suid root.
   This is no longer the case with more recent (e.g. those from 2003 or later)
   versions.

Q: I get bad performance (FPS very low!) with the game.
A: 1) To increase the performance of the game, you should use hardware acceleration,
   i.e. OpenGL.  In order to start FreedroidRPG with OpenGL output, use the command
   line -o, like 'freedroidRPG -o' or like 'freedroidRPG -o -w' if you prefer to
   have a window.
   2) Also you might try to lower your X screen color depth to 16 bits per pixel. For
   that, (as root) edit your /etc/X11/XF86Config file and add a line like 
   DefaultDepth 16 instead of the e.g. DefaultDepth 24 that you might be having there.
