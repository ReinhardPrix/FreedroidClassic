* yep, and now it's finally time: v1.0.1 seems ripe, the "final" version
  of  Freedroid Classic!

  -> sorry, for more detailed news, look at Releasetext and ChangeLog (which
  might be too detailed though! ;)


* 0.8.4 now branches off the main cvs-tree, in order to allow for
 patches relating to this (currently) last "classic" version of Freedroid.
