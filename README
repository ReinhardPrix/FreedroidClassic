Welcome to

    FREEDROID :  R E A D M E
   --------------------------

A Linux game by Johannes Prix and Reinhard Prix, inpired by 
Andrew Braybrook's classic Paradroid on the good old Commodore C64.

Installation & Compilation
--------------------------
!! Please see the file INSTALL for instructions !!


Introduction
============
This is a clone of the classic game "Paradroid" on Commodore 64
with some improvements and extensions to the classic version.

The Game
========
In this game, you control a robot, depicted by a small white ball with a
few numbers within an interstellar spaceship consisting of several decks
connected by elevators.
The aim of the game is to destroy all enemy robots, depicted by small black
balls with a few numbers, by either shooting them or seizing control over them
by creating connections in a short subgame of electric circuits.

Input Devices
=============
Currently, the only way to control the white robot is via keyboard, using
the cursor keys and the space key.  Cursors are for moving aroung and aiming.
Space bar is for fireing (with direction) or for changing to transfer mode,
a prerequisite for seizing control over an enemy druid.

The Level Editor
================
There was a level editor with the MS-DOS Version of this game, which we
programmed back in 1992-1994.  For the Linux version there is a level editor
integrated into the game.  You can access it via the menu.  You can also
save the levels you have created, although the saved levels are currently
damaged, sorry.

Saving
======
No, saving is not possible.  Not now and not in the near future.  Sorry.
But I think that would also take away much of the game difficulty, and we
havn't designed another ship yet...
