.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B FreedroidRPG
is a graphical single player role playing game inspired by games like Diablo and Gothic.

In a far-future world, almost all services and jobs were done by robots and droids,
most especially the more dangerous ones like police or military services.
The company providing the operating systems for these bots 'MegaSoft' used their
closed source operating system monopoly and a back door within it's operation system
to enslave humanity all over the galaxy.

But this is not the main problem.  Some 20 years after the MS has taken control of the 
universe, suddenly a very strange thing happened.  The bots suddenly rebelled against 
the MS and didn't respond to the commands of their former superiors at the MS any more.
Mankind was under attack by it's bots and had to flee to various secret underground
caverns on remote planets of the universe and cannot return any more.

This is where the game begins.  The Tux awakens from 200000 years of stasis to save
the world.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B -v \fRor\fB --version
Prints out FreedroidRPG version information.
.TP 8
.B -q \fRor\fB --nosound
This option will suppress all sound output.  
Very useful if you don't have your sound card configured yet or
don't have any sound hardware at all.
.TP 8
.B -f \fRor\fB --fullscreen
This instructs FreedroidRPG to work in full screen mode, which is the default mode of operation.  
Please note that it is strongly recommended that your X Window system is configured to feature
a move with 640x480 screen resolution, but it will also work if this is not the case.
Note that fullscreen or window mode can also be toggled from within the game via the options
menu.
.TP 8
.B -w \fRor\fB --window
Start FreedroidRPG in a window rather than using full screen mode.
.TP 8
.B -j \fRor\fB --sensitivity
This option can be used to control joystick sensitivity.
.TP 8
.B -d LEVEL \fRor\fB --debug=LEVEL
This option can be used to control debug output of the game.  Debug output will be printed to
stderr, i.e. in most cases to the console you started FreedroidRPG from.  The variable LEVEL
controls how much debug output you would like to have.  LEVEL 0 is the default and means (almost)
no debug output.  LEVEL 1 prints the most important debug messages and LEVEL 2 or LEVEL 3 print
(almost) all debug output, which might be quite a lot.

.SH HOW TO PLAY
.B Moving and Firing
.RS
The influence device can be moved inside the ship by either using keyboard input or joystick directions.
Keyboard control can be done by either using cursor keys or the Quake and Half-life style a-w-s-d keys combination.
Firing can be done by either using the crosshair and the left mouse button or by pressing a direction key and pressing
space in addition or by holding a joystick direction and pressing a joystick button.
.RE
.B Entering Elevators and Consoles
.RS
The influence device can move from one deck to another deck using the elevators of the freighter.  
To do this, you must step onto an elevator plate, and then either press the e key or press the middle mouse button or appropriate joystick button.
Entering consoles is done in a similar way.  You have to stand directly in front of a console terminal and then press the e key to activate the console.
Inside the console you will have access to a small scale map of the current deck, a side elevation of the ship and to the droid database of the ship.  Note however, that access to the droid database is achieved via the security clearance of the host you currently control, i.e. you will only be able to view droid data for droids that are lower or equal to the host you currently control.
.RE
.B The takeover subgame (Taking control of other droids)
.RS
To take control of another robot, you must first enter transfer mode.  This is done by either standing still and holding space bar pressed (and keeping space bar pressed afterwards) or by holing down the right mouse button or holding town appropriate joystick button.  While in takeover mode, the influence device can try to initiate takeover by touching the host it wishes to control.  As soon as another robot is touched while in takeover mode, takeover subgame will be initiated and control of the new host will be seized, provided that the takeover subgame is won.
.RE
.B Playing the takeover subgame
.RS
After the takeover subgame was initiated, the two droids struggling for control will be presented.  
Then the player gets to decide which side of the takeover game he wants to play.  
The player on the left side takes the yellow color, the player on the right side takes the magenta color.  
Note that which side to choose may be the most important decision of the takeover subgame,
cause one side may host strong tactical advantages over the other.  
After sides have been chosen, the takeover capsules will be placed.
Each droid has a limited number of capsules to place and must try to convert the central status bar to his color.
The number of capsules you have at your disposal depends on the clearance of the host you currently control.
Once the takeover subgame is won, the player will have control over the new bot while the old host is destroyed.
Control over the new host also means inheriting the movement properties and the weapons of this robot.
Loss of takeover subgame results in the current host, if one is present, being destroyed or the influence itself
being burnt out and destroyed if no host was present.
.RE
.B Notes on energy loss
.RS
The influence device depends on hosts to control.  Whether currently controlling a host or not, the influence device will always lose energy due to construction properties.  When taking control of a new host, the influence device will also take control of the energy this droid had left, which will be even more the higher the bot you take control of.  However, higher droids also tend to put up more resistance against the control of the influence device, resulting in faster loss of energy.  Therefore it is recommended to change hosts frequently in order to keep the influence device well powered.  Note that there are some refresh field, where some of the energy lost so far can be restored.  But note also, that 
.B only energy loss due to collisions, explosions and enemy fire
can be restored this way, while energy loss due to host resistance is permanently lost until the host is changed again.

.SH BUGS, LIMITATIONS AND HELP
While the FreedroidRPG engine can now be considered fairly stable, the story and characters are still far from completed and also the maps are seriously underdeveloped.  If you encounter any problems or bugs, have some idea for future FreedroidRPG development or wish to contribute in some way, please send e-mail to <freedroid-discussion@lists.sourceforge.net>.
