4. Combat behaviour:
   a. introduce reaction time:  States and decisions only made every e.g. 2 seconds or so.
      (that should give the player a chance to compete.  Otherywise they might become too powerful.)
   b. analyze current state and set flags: WILL_BE_HIT_BY_BULLET

2. Extend the game/graphics engine
