Freedroid Installation 
======================

[ 0) if you have downloaded your source from the cvs-archive 
   you have to start by typing `./autogen.sh']

1) autogen will run `./configure' - you don't need to
2) type `make' to compile the package

3)a) type `make install'. By default this will try to install in 
   /usr/local/, in which case you have to be root to do that.
   You can instead specify `--prefix=<yourdir>' to `configure', in
   which case `make install' will install in <yourdir>.

ALTERNATIVELY:

3)b) you can run the game locally by typing: 
   `cd src' followed by `./freedroid'

If you don't have sound or SDL-sound installed, you might have to run
freedroid with the command-line option `-q'.

Have fun!
