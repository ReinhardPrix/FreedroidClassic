Freedroid Installation
======================
[ 0) if you have downloaded your source from the cvs-archive
   you have to start by typing `./autogen.sh']

1) type `./configure'
2) type `make' to compile the package

3)a) type `make install'. By default this will try to install in
   /usr/local/, in which case you have to be root to do that.
   You can instead specify `--prefix=<yourdir>' to `configure', in
   which case `make install' will install in <yourdir>.

ALTERNATIVELY:

3)b) you can run the game locally by typing:
   `cd src' followed by `./freedroid'

Have fun!

If you have problems with the compilation/installation, please send me an email:

GCW Zero Specific
=================
To compile for GCW 0 (MIPS), you need the toolchain setup correctly from:
http://www.gcw-zero.com/develop

There's a Windows (CYGWIN) Toolchain rady-made also, see Dingoonity Forums.

After you have the toolchain setup and ready (the toolchain specific executables
in your path), you can compile FreeDroid for GCW Zero. 
gcw0/freedroid-gcw0confcompileomakepk.sh can help in compiling (most likely, it
wont work without editing unless your toolchain happens to be in the same path 
as on my box).

For problems / discussion on the GCW Zero port, go to:

or email me at: ville [dot] aakko [at] gmail [dot] com.

Have Fun!
