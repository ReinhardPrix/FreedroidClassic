Freedroid Installation 
======================

[ 0) if you have downloaded your source from the cvs-archive 
   you have to start by typing `./autogen.sh']

1) run `./configure' 
2) type `make' to compile the package

[ 2)a) If you have downloaded the 'minimal' package, then you need to
       render the Tux images on your machine, a time-consuming but fully
       automated process, that requires Blender (best version 2.27) to
       be installed on your machine.  If you have that installed (and in
       your search path, so that it can be found, you can now type
       
       sh render_and_symlink_images.sh

       to create all the substitute symlinks and rendered images from the
       blender sources.  This step is ONLY nescessary, if you try to build
       from the 'minimal' download package.]

3)a) type `make install'. By default this will try to install in 
   /usr/local/, in which case you have to be root to do that.
   You can instead specify `--prefix=<yourdir>' to `configure', in
   which case `make install' will install in <yourdir>.

ALTERNATIVELY:

3)b) you can run the game locally by typing: 
   `cd src' followed by `./freedroid'

If you don't have sound or SDL-sound installed, you might have to run
freedroid with the command-line option `-q'.

If you want to use your OpenGL hardware for more frames, you should run
freedroid with the command-line option `-o'.

Have fun!
