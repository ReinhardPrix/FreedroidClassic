Freedroid Installation
======================
[ 0) if you have downloaded your source from the cvs-archive
   you have to start by typing `./autogen.sh']

1) type `./configure'
2) type `make' to compile the package

3)a) type `make install'. By default this will try to install in
   /usr/local/, in which case you have to be root to do that.
   You can instead specify `--prefix=<yourdir>' to `configure', in
   which case `make install' will install in <yourdir>.

ALTERNATIVELY:

3)b) you can run the game locally by typing:
   `cd src' followed by `./freedroid'

Have fun!
