New graphics design, Possible solutions:

    1. Stay with Ball and number design
       + simpler
       + easyer to tell droids apart and to classify a droid
       + less renderings and images required
       + design stays invariant under direction changes of the droid

    2. Change to individual renderings of all droids
       + possibly better graphical impression
       - requires handling of the directions a droid is facing
       - requires renderings of ALL droids
       - might make it difficult to tell droid types apart

    3. Try to get the CVS log back on
	- seems to be broken?

For now, we stick to the first path, I think all aggreed.  Additions? Comments? jp.

Game Extension:  New enemy type:  Not robot but genetically tailored (alien) life form, that
cannot be taken over (otherwise we cannot create difficult fighting situations where you *have*
to do some figthing).  Might also be numberd, but differently shaped, with moving tentacles as
animation of health and numbers in a triangle shape instead of neatly in a line as in droids.

Game Extension:  New Weapon:  Homing missiles??
Depreciated by Lanzz

Game Extension:  Lightning ray:  Yes, we really could draw the whole ray in a flashy 
lightning-shape.  I think I know already a way how we could implement that.  Multiple 
phases possible of course.

Game Extension:  New Weapon:  Lasers
