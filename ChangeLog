	* menu.c, view.c, global.h, graphics.c, influ.c, input.c, main.c:
	o) further improvements of the joystick fireing
	o) incorporated "Nighthawk"-type mouse control
	   based on a patch sent in by Tanel Kylaots <mou@tdl.ee>

2002-06-09  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac, game.dat, global.h, influ.c, init.c:
	Improved (I hope) the collision-damage handling:  Now not the difference in
	class of droid but in weight of droid is taken as the basis of the calculation.
	Further a constants section in game.dat has been added, where the player can
	also calibrate the collision damage via a constant for his own mod.
	The "sucking in" problem has also been addressed:  Getting sucked into another
	robot should now occur less likely (i.e. not on my machine, as usual). jp.

	* new_mission_2.mission, text.c:
	Added missing events section to the second new mission too.
	Game looks pretty cool to me right now.  We should release 0.8.2 I think.

	* classical_paradroid_mission.mission, bullet.c, proto.h, text.c:
	Added more text for hit droids.
	Added the missing event section to the classical mission.

	* new_mission_1.mission, new_ship_1.maps, defs.h, influ.c, init.c,
	misc.c, proto.h, struct.h, text.c: 
	Events fully functional implemented and read from the mission file.
	There are event triggers and event actions.
	Of course more than one trigger can be used to trigger one action.
	Put the triggers to good use on the first new mission.
	Also adapted the map file a little bit more so that it is not so empty.
	Clasical mission currently not functional due to missing event section.

2002-06-09  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Patches/mouse-patch.1:
	patch submitted by Tanel Kylaots <mou@tdl.ee> to add mouse
	functionality similar to Nighthawk.

2002-06-09  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* init.c, misc.c, view.c:
	TestEvent: Mapchange on Level 4 at (6,2): Seems to work!! cool!

	Added structures for special periodic statements of some special droids.

	* bullet.c, enemy.c, influ.c, init.c, proto.h, struct.h, text.c:
	Added text for influs blast damage and also more flexibility:  When influ
	received damage from a blast he says one of three possible messages.
	That seems quite fine.

	* enemy.c, influ.c, main.c, view.c:
	Added text for the refreshes, haha.
	Added text for collisions, haha.

	* global.h, graphics.c, menu.c, sound.c, struct.h:
	Integrated music/sound volume and gamma correction into the new GameConfig.
	Added structures for other droids texts as well.

	* menu.c, struct.h, view.c, TODO, defs.h, enemy.c, global.h, init.c:
	Added Draw_Position and drawing of current position similar to drawing FPS.
	Added structure "configuration_for_freedroid" and a variable "GameConfig", that
	now collects together the desired Draw_Framerate, Draw_Energy and Draw_Position.

	* global.h, init.c, input.c, main.c, struct.h, view.c:
	Added text for the 001 to say.  Very useful!

	* map.c, misc.c, rahmen.c:
	Removed obsolete functions itoa and ltoa.
	(sprintf is a much more powerful tool!)

2002-06-08  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* defs.h, influ.c, struct.h, svgaemu.c, view.c:
	rewritten FireBullet(): simpler structure now, and allows continuous
	shot-directions when using analog joystick. Not quite C64 original,
	but quite cool! ;)

	* Makefile.am, global.h, input.c, joy.c, keyboard.c, proto.h:
	merged joy.c and keyboard.c into new file input.c.
	adapted Makefile.am (don't forget to automake+configure ;)

	I hope they are historical and not caused by a bug in the Level editor.

	* enemy.c, init.c, map.c, struct.h, game.dat, ship_1.maps:

	even the influencer!  Real polite.)
	Corrected some minor bugs in the first map.

	* enemy.c:
	Reworking enemy movement.  Starting to add new behaviour.

	DebugPrintf () now takes a debug-level and standard printf()-arguments.
	Put all existing DebugPrintf() to debug-level2, and all current
	printf() statements are now DebugPrintf (1, ..).
	To activate these debug-statements, run freedroid with the command-line

2002-06-07  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* new_mission_2.mission, new_ship_2.droids:

	* init.c, classical_paradroid_mission.mission, game.dat, ship_1.droids, ship_1.maps:
	Implemented calibrating constants withing game dat for bullet speed and damage.
	Used these constants to get bullet speed back to paradroid normal.
	Corrected the minor mistakes that were introduced into the paradroid map in the
	mapfile format conversion process.  Also corrected some mistakes that existed due
	to the old format not being able to store apropriate information.
	Restored the classical paradroid mission back to original mission goal.

	* ship_1.droids, enemy.c, graphics.c, map.c, menu.c, struct.h:
	Corrected the bug, that junked the screen when changing tileset in the

	* new_ship_1.maps:
	Worked a bit to improve the new map.

	* influ.c, init.c, struct.h, takeover.c:
	Modified energy handling so that after takeover, the influe has old energy
	PLUS the hosts energy.  Otherwise the influ can be shot down with one shot
	if he controls a 249 or below robot, which wasn't the case in the C64 version
	and which makes the game MUCH more playable and also more fun I think. jp.

	* classical_paradroid_mission.mission, new_mission_1.mission, new_mission_2.mission, defs.h, enemy.c, init.c, main.c, misc.c, struct.h, view.c:
	Implemented mission target MustReachLevel.

	In the latter case, remaining time to hold out will be printed to the combat window.
	Added mission target strings to the mission files as required.

	* Homepage/Freedroid_Manual.tex, TASK_CHART, menu.c:

	* ship_1.crew, ship_1.droids, init.c, map.c, struct.h, Makefile.am, classical_paradroid_mission.mission, new_mission_1.mission, new_ship_1.crew, new_ship_1.droids:
	Completely reworked the shape of crew files.
	They are now well readable.
	Droid types can be entered by typing their name instead of their number.

	* classical_paradroid_mission.mission, new_mission_1.mission, init.c:
	Added next mission pointer:  After completition of one mission, the mission
	indicated by the next mission pointer in the mission file will be loaded and
	started.  Classical Paradroid now points to the new mission 1.  The new mission
	one points to the new mission 2, which does not yet exist.  Otherwise it
	seems to work quite well.

2002-06-05  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* classical_paradroid_mission.mission, new_mission_1.mission, init.c, struct.h:
	Added mission target MustBeClass, fully functional.

2002-06-05  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* menu.c:
	Changed Cheat-menu font to FPS-font... much better now! ;)

2002-06-05  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TASK_CHART, defs.h, init.c, main.c, proto.h:
	Reactivated "font05" for the FPS_Display, i.e. FPS_Display_BFont, might
	be good for Cheatmenu too?

2002-06-05  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ChangeLog:
	updated with latest changes, some cleanup, put our sourceforge mail addresses.

	* menu.c:
	started porting Cheatmenu to use SDL-screen (more convenient), using
	printf_SDL() and GetString(). Should be working 90% ok now.

	* proto.h:
	new functions: printf_SDL() and putchar_SDL().

	* text.c: added 2 new text-functions:
	int putchar_SDL (SDL_Surface *Surface, int x, int y, int c)
	void printf_SDL (SDL_Surface *screen, int x, int y, char *fmt, ...)
	which extend the BFont-functions PrintString() and PutChar() by using
	the global cursor position MyCursorX/Y.
	Passing -1 as coordinate will use the current cursor-position to
	write. Cursor position is updated.
	The screen is updated after writing.

	Ported GetString() to SDL using the above text-functions.
	echo=1 (stdout) is currently not working, only echo=2 (SDL-echo).
	Backspace should be treated correctly now, but this function still
	needs some testing.

2002-06-05  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* menu.c, TASK_CHART, new_ship_1.maps:
	Added "color change" (="change tileset") option for the level editor.

	* Homepage/Freedroid_Manual.tex, TASK_CHART,
	classical_paradroid_mission.mission, game.dat,
	new_mission_1.mission, new_ship_1.crew, init.c: 
	Now the flag "AdvancedFighting" is read in for every droid, though it doesn't
	have an effect in the program jet.
	Now the mission files can contain an arbitrary number of starting points for
	the mission, specified by the obvious string.  Seems to work well.
	Added appropriate defintions in the mission files of course.

	* Homepage/Freedroid_Home_Page.tex, Homepage/Freedroid_Manual.tex,
	TASK_CHART, keyboard.c, menu.c:

	* ChangeLog:
	used Emacs for automatic CVS-log -> Changelog creation.
	Now there's a lot of junk to clean up, but that has time...
	Please use "C-x v a" from time to time to add Changelog entries
	from your cvs log, and edit them correspondingly to keep only
	'relevant' changes.

	* map.c, ship.c:
	Improved lift algorithm: first blit ship "lights off", then
	blit active level and lift-row rectangles from "lights on" ship-picture,
	then update screen. --> Results look&feel much more "stable".

	* blocks.c, global.h, graphics.c, init.c, map.c, misc.c, proto.h:
	some code cleanup: *completely* removed obsolete variables
	RealScreen, InternalScreen, Outline320x200 , together with
	old block display functions Display*Block().

	Worked a bit on the briefing text of the new mission.
	Corrected some smaller mistakes in the paradroid font.
	Added missing feature to TODO list.

2002-06-04  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* map.c, ship.c:
	Improved lift algorithm: first blit ship "lights off", then
	blit active level and lift-row rectangles from "lights on" ship-picture,
	then update screen. --> Results look&feel much more "stable".

	* blocks.c, global.h, graphics.c, init.c, map.c, misc.c, proto.h:
	some code cleanup: *completely* removed obsolete variables
	RealScreen, InternalScreen, Outline320x200 , together with
	old block display functions Display*Block().

	* ship.c, graphics.c:
	some cleanup in the lift code and picture.
	(don't forget to "install" new pics)

2002-06-04  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ship.c, vars.h:
	Resized Bastians droids to fit into the console.  For now, thats the
	easiest way to get the console working again.
	Repaired the console text format to fit into the window.  Good. jp.

	* init.c, text.c:
	Worked a bit on the briefing text of the new mission.
	Corrected some smaller mistakes in the paradroid font.
	Added missing feature to TODO list.

2002-06-03  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* init.c, main.c, menu.c, misc.c:
	Added a mission selection menu.

	* defs.h, menu.c:
	Added bastians "free droid" as the background for the credits menu subsection.

	* main.c, map.c:
	Corrected the too slow map-read-routines.  Now its FAST!!!!
	Corrected smaller bugs in classic paradroid map.
	Saved all maps in new map file format.

2002-06-03  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* main.c, map.c, misc.c, proto.h, ship.c, sound.c, struct.h, global.h, init.c:
	Useless detail: Global name change "elevator" -> "lift"

2002-06-03  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* keyboard.c, main.c, menu.c, proto.h, struct.h:
	Worked a bit on the new area.
	Introduced new robot types 998, 997, ... , 991 , 990.
	Introduced flag for new fighting behaviour, but its not yet read in.
	New mission is the default for now.

	* enemy.c, init.c:
	Corrected the aggression of droids being too high.
	Elevators are currently broken:  I see only blue screen while in enevator!
	Why is this?

2002-06-03  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* blocks.c, defs.h, global.h, graphics.c, init.c, map.c, proto.h, ship.c, ship.h, struct.h, takeover.c:
	new method for ShowElevators():
	show ship-picture "lights off" first, update screen, then Blit in the
	ship picture "lights on", but update only the rectangles for the current
	lift and level. Seems to work ok now.

	This method has the advantage of requiring only two ship-pictures instead
	of one per level and lift, but has the disadvantage of requiring the
	lift and level rectangles to be provided. I still think this is an
	improvement, as these rectangle-info could be entered in a "Ship-Editor",
	say, if extensive "ship-editing" should ever become fashionable...

2002-06-03  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* map.c, menu.c, proto.h:
	Removed the obsolete "x"-encoding of waypoints within maps.
	So we can now plant waypoints anywhere, on refreshed, lifts and all that too.
	And I added the missing refresh under the waypoint on the yellow level.
	Loading takes a bit long... I might remove the forced writing again in
	favour of arbitrary dynamic waypoint structures.

	* map.c, vars.h, defs.h, enemy.c, init.c, main.c:
	Fixed some bugs in the level loading function.
	Set MAX_WP_CONNECTIONS from 4 to 12
	Set MAPWAYPOINTS from 30 to 100
	Changed the format of ships on disk into something better human-readable.

2002-06-02  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* defs.h, enemy.c, init.c, map.c, vars.h:
	Briefing texts are now taken from the mission file and therefore the long static
	strings removed from the code.
	Which ship file, elevator file and crew file to use is also deducted from the
	mission file now. jp.

	* defs.h, init.c, keyboard.c, main.c, menu.c, proto.h:
	Mission briefing text is now successfully read and used from the mission file.

	* global.h, init.c, menu.c, vars.h, view.c, defs.h:
	Removed the limitation to ALLDRUIDTYPES different druid types maximal to
	arbitrary number of droid types all specified in game.dat.
	Started to set up a format and example of a mission file.

	* menu.c:
	Connections between waypoints can now conveniently be established via the
	C key.  You should try it;) jp.

	* map.c, menu.c:
	Waypoints can now also be toggled via the Level Editor.

	* graphics.c, menu.c, proto.h:
	Level editor now also shows the waypoint connections.  Most convenient. jp.

	* init.c, proto.h:
	Integrated the notes concerning the droids into game.dat.  Removed the static
	Droid initialisation function from the code.

	* init.c, ship.c, struct.h, vars.h:
	Added separate Height, Weight, Drive, Brain, Sensor 1, Sensor 2, Sensor 3,
	and Armament variables into the Druidmap structure and under the control
	of game.dat.

	* init.c, vars.h:
	Added calibration entries to modify all droid simulaneously in game.dat.

	* enemy.c, struct.h, vars.h:
	Eliminated the Druidmap initialization from vars.h.  All info for the
	Druidmap is now read from the external game.dat file, haha.

2002-06-01  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* init.c, main.c, menu.c, misc.c, proto.h, ship.c, struct.h, view.c:
	Adapted calls to DisplayBanner() to new Parameters "left" and "right",
	removed calls to old SetInfoline().

	* takeover.c:
	Takeover-game pretty much complete now: Added display of player-droids
	and proper Infoline-display via DisplayBanner().

	* rahmen.c:
	jp's new DisplayBanner() seems to have overtaken SetInfoline(), which I
	have now removed.
	Adapted DisplayBanner() to allow passing of non-standard left and
	right entries, which is needed in Takeover-game.

	* takeover.c, takeover.h, graphics.c:
	Takeover game: "current" animation now complete.

2002-06-01  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* defs.h, influ.c, init.c, struct.h, vars.h:
	Almost all Druidmap variables now under control of game.dat.

	* init.c, struct.h, vars.h:
	More variables put under control of the game.dat file.

2002-06-01  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* proto.h, takeover.c, takeover.h:
	Further polishing of Takeover-game: "current" animation now works
	"in principle", but is not finished yet in the details.

	* graphics.c:
	set our window-dimensions to the more standard format (640x480,
	ie. 320x240 * 2). Looks a bit "strange" in the beginning when you're
	used to our "cut-off" window, but I think this is much more reasonable...

	* view.c:
	added new function Fill_Rect (SDL_Rect rect, SDL_Color color), which
	fills the given rectangle with the RGB-color. This is now used in
	Takeover to color the User_Rect.
	SetUserfenster() is too specific to 8bpp and the UserFenster, and
	should be dumped in favor of Fill_Rect() !!

2002-06-01  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* proto.h, view.c:
	Adapted PutEnemy to better fit the needs of the takeover game.

2002-05-31  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* menu.c, init.c, main.c:
	Started to implement reading of droid data from outside file "game.dat".
	Robot names are already read successfully from there.
	The file is ascii-readable and well documented and flexible.

2002-05-31  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* defs.h, graphics.c, takeover.c, takeover.h, view.c:
	Takeover game now at least "playable" again in new engine, but still quite
	some polishing necessary...

2002-05-31  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am, menu.c, misc.c, proto.h, ship.c:
	Split the (too big) misc.c up into misc.c and menu.c.
	Menu should now contain all menu functions and their helper functions.
	This includes the level editor, which is not too big.  Edited Makefile.am.

2002-05-30  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* misc.c:
	Level editor now shows also the waypoints, but not yet the connections.
	I'm sort of tired and think I'll close for today.  Have fun, jp.

	* map.c:
	Hurray!  The SaveShip function now reproduces exactly the loaded Level.
	That means we have a functioning Level editor again, allthough convenient
	waypoint editing must still be incorporated into it.  But maps basically
	can be edited.  I might do that later. jp.

	* defs.h, map.c:
	Save level procedure now seems to work almost:  wp are still missing.

	* map.c, map.h:
	Added a bit more documentation to the ship-loading functions and also improved
	the ship file format to be a bit better human-readable in my opinion. jp.

	* ship.c:
	Improved the way the map is shown at the console:  Center of map now in center
	of the combat window.  Still room for further improvement.

	* ship.c:
	Elevators are now correctly highlighted too.

	* ship.c, view.c:
	Elevator is now working (well) again.  New pictures needed and added.

	* defs.h:
	Replaced more bmps by gifs. That saves up to 30 times the space on disk.

	* graphics.c, init.c, misc.c, rahmen.c, ship.c, takeover.c,
	view.c, blocks.c, colodefs.h, defs.h, global.h: 
	Removed too small images from 0.7.4.
	Removed more german.  Added some doku.

	* blocks.c, defs.h, graphics.c, ship.c:
	Replaced all SDL_LoadBMP commands with IMG_Load. --> complete file
	format independence. 
	Removed obsolete and redundant graphic files.

	* blocks.c, defs.h, graphics.c:
	Reduced redundant pixmaps and converted some to gif with costs 80% less. jp.

	* map.c, vars.h, view.c, enemy.c, init.c:
	The "jittering" bug has been resolved. At least on my old and new machine, jp.

	* misc.c, proto.h:
	Removed all german from misc.c.
	Added and updated docu in the process.
	Removed obsolete functions my_abs and my_sqrt.

	* map.c, misc.c, proto.h, rahmen.c, ship.c, takeover.c, view.c,
	ReplaceIt.awk, bullet.c, defs.h, enemy.c, global.h, graphics.c,
	influ.c, init.c, main.c: 
	Renamed "Feindesliste" to "AllEnemys" like in "AllBullets" and "AllBlasts".
	Renamed "Rahmen" to "Banner" since thats english and describes it well.
	Removed all german from main.c.
	Removed all german from view.c.
	We ARE and international project after all.  Have fun, jp.

2002-05-29  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* init.c:
	Corrected the "title screen coped and bannerd when vied the second time" bug

	* view.c:
	Corrected the "framerate not well readable" bug.

	* map.c, struct.h, view.c:
	Corrected the "garbage on screen outside ship" bug.

	* enemy.c, graphics.c, influ.c, init.c, main.c, proto.h, text.c, vars.h:
	more colde cleanup: obsolete prototypes, german dokus, messed main strucute,
	senseless&obsolete german definitions.

	* init.c, keyboard.c, main.c, proto.h:
	More code cleanup:  Moved special key reactions into a separate
	function in keyboard.c. 

	* main.c, misc.c, proto.h, global.h, init.c:
	Moved the framerate computation into separate functions outside of
	main() and main.c. 
	The guy who called the code a mess is still right though ;)

	* misc.c:
	Corrected the stupid typo in the Credits section.  Also added
	background image to it. 

	* misc.c, view.c:
	Reactivated "Flashes" when fireing disruptor shots.
	Credits section added to the big Escape Menu.

	* misc.c, view.c:
	Modified Homepage to display sourceforge logo as required by the sourseforge.
	Added background image for the homepage.  Tell me if you now find it hard to read.
	Level editor is working all again, except for the saving menu option still.
	Added Bastians latest graphics and made console react to larger image sizes.

2002-05-28  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* misc.c:
	Reactivated most of the menus and also most of the level editor.

	* defs.h, misc.c, proto.h, rahmen.c, takeover.c, view.c:
	Reactivated and cleaned up single player menu.

2002-05-28  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sound.c, system.h:
	stupid script that executes aclocal, autoheader, automake & autoconf
	to save typing. In addation automake is called with --add-missing,
	so you don't have to worry about missing scripts.

2002-05-27  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* bullet.c, defs.h, graphics.c, influ.c, init.c, misc.c, proto.h,
	rahmen.c, ship.c, text.c, view.c: 
	Finally reactivated the original Paradroid font, which is now available
	via BFont/DisplayText etc.

	* bullet.c, defs.h, graphics.c, influ.c, init.c, main.c, misc.c, view.c:
	Added a new and smaller font, that might be good for the scrolling text.

	* init.c:
	Added a new Font, that might come in handy for some things.
	Its not the original Paradroid font, which might come later, sorry.

	* defs.h, global.h, graphics.c, influ.c, init.c, map.c, misc.c, sound.c, text.c:
	Activated new title, also for the background of the scrolling font.
	Had some sound problems:  The very first sound call of freedroid seems
	to be always completely ignored??? THIS REMAINS UNEXPLAINED.

	* bullet.c, defs.h, influ.c, init.c, misc.c, rahmen.c, sound.c, text.c:
	Improved sliding through H_GANZTUERE horizontal doors.  Now it seems smooth.

	* defs.h, main.c, misc.c:
	Finally removed the real "GetChar" bug by setting the ALLBLAST constant from
	5 to 100.  Did the same for the ALLBULLETS.  Happy hacking,jp.   :-)

2002-05-27  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* defs.h, global.h, init.c, struct.h, takeover.c, text.c, view.c:
	started writing proper Highscore-list handling (in Debriefing() )
	not functional yet, so Debriefing now returns immediately.
	Deactivated Takeover-game() which has to be ported to new engine yet.

2002-05-27  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* proto.h, graphics.c, init.c, misc.c:
	Deleted old InitPalette crap.

	* init.c, misc.c, influ.c:
	"GetChar" bug removed by undoing free(ScoreText) which was never allocated?

	* view.c, global.h, graphics.c, init.c, keyboard.c, main.c,
	misc.c, proto.h, ship.c: 
	The notion of conceptview has left the game, since resizing is possible anyway.
	TakeScreenshot now has its own function in graphics.
	GetString in Debriebing currently disabled:  See if "GetChar" bug vanishes?

2002-05-26  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* global.h, init.c, proto.h, rahmen.c, ship.c, ship.h, text.c, vars.h, view.c:
	rp went Berserk on Text-handling machinery ;)

	*) removed lots of old brain-damaged functions

	*) Main player is now: DisplayText(), which now takes an
	  SDL_Rect argument with the Text-window to write in. This takes care
	  of clipping and line-breaks! The prev clip-rect is restored after this.
	  if NULL is passed, no clipping/line-breaking is done.

	  The line-breaks are handled by ImprovedCheckUmbruch() which has been
	  adapted appropriately.

	*) DisplayText now returns TRUE if text was written _inside_ the
	   clip-rectangle, FALSE otherwise.
	  This info is used by ScrollText to know when text has been scrolled out.

	*) Therefore: SetTextBorder & Co useless and have been dumped.

	*)  There are two global Rectangles: (def'd in vars.h)
		User_Rect:  which is our Userfenster
	        Menu_Rect:  used in Menu-writing
	  please add further rectangles as you need them.

	*) The CombatRectangle in Assemble_Combat_Picture() has been replaced
	   by User_Rect, in an effort to minimise names for the same thing.

	Ok, everythings seems to works ok so far, but please keep me updated
	if problems appear of if you have questions concerning Text-writing.

2002-05-26  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* graphics.c, init.c:
	Little color bug removed.

	* graphics.c, misc.c:
	Level colors should be restored now.
	Pictures are also of a form that should well work with the new gamma=1 default.

2002-05-26  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* init.c:
	erroneous #include of nonexistent "paths.h" removed. (sorry)

2002-05-26  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* SDL_rotozoom.c, enemy.c, graphics.c, influ.c, main.c, map.c, proto.h, view.c:
	Erradicated some warnings.
	Eliminated some german expressions and function names.

2002-05-26  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am, defs.h, graphics.c, init.c, sound.c, view.c:
	"make install" ist now functional. (I hope ;)
	freedroid now expects its data (graphics,sound,map) in DATADIR,
	which is defined in Makefile to $(pkgdatadir), which defaults
	to /usr/local/share/freedroid.
	If you want to change this location, you can make with the command:
	make pkgdatadir=<YOUR_DIR>

	Please use GRAPHICS_DIR, SOUND_DIR, MAP_DIR  for loading data-files!
	These are defined in defs.h

2002-05-26  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* blocks.c, defs.h, global.h, graphics.c, main.c, proto.h, rahmen.c, ship.c:
	Combat screen can be rescaled using the "O" and "I" keys.

	* blocks.c, defs.h, global.h, init.c, ship.c, view.c:
	Resizing of screen works!  You can try it at the console.

	* enemy.c:
	Robots fire now correctly at the influencer again.
	Hey, the game seems pretty much playable again, except for the
	takeover game perhaps....

	* enemy.c, influ.c, main.c, proto.h:
	Refreshes are now finally animated again, although not completely.
	Influence-Enemy collisions have been repaired to work with the new coordinates.

	* enemy.c:
	Reactivated and repaired EnemyEnemyCollisions.

	* influ.c, map.c, ship.c:
	Visibility is now handled correctly and secure with the new coordinates.

	* bullet.c, defs.h, influ.c, map.c:
	Bullet-Robot collisions reactivated.
	Influence-Wall collision handling improved.

	* bullet.c, influ.c, proto.h, view.c:
	Bullets and Blasts now use the new coordinates too, at least on the screen.

	* defs.h, influ.c, main.c, map.c, map.h:
	Improved Influence-Wall-Collision-Handling.  Still not perfect, but growing.
	I think the whole function might be completely rewritten in the process...

	* init.c, map.c, map.h:
	Doors open and close again, but especially there the weaknesses of the
	influence-wall-collision handling become apparent.  Something has to be done.

	* defs.h, influ.c, map.c, misc.c, proto.h:
	Influence-Wall collisions are working again, although some fine-tuning should
	occur at some point to ensure smooth gameplay.

	* ship.c, struct.h, vars.h, view.c, enemy.c, influ.c, init.c,
	main.c, map.c, misc.c: 
	Influ and Enemys now use the new coordinates.
	Koodinates (1,1) mean that the influ is in the CENTER!!! of the square (1,1).
	EnemyEnemyCollisions currently disabled.

2002-05-25  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* blocks.c, defs.h, global.h, graphics.c, init.c, main.c, ship.c, vars.h, view.c:
	Activated scaling of blocksize.  Its a draft and I cant continue now because
	of Ms. Schnedl.  To deactivate it, please comment out the last line in
	InitNewGame, looking somewhat like "ShowDeckMap()". thanks, jp.

2002-05-25  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am, proto.h:
	added SDL_rotozoom.[ch] to Makefile.am,
	removed #include "SDL" in proto.h, as it's included in "system.h"

2002-05-25  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* map.c, map.h, misc.c, ship.c, takeover.c, vars.h, view.c,
	ReplaceIt, ReplaceIt.awk, blocks.c, defs.h, enemy.c, influ.c,
	init.c: 
	Replaced ALL occurenced of BLOCKBREITE with Block_Width and ALL occurenced
	of BLOCKHOEHE with Block_Height, using the new ReplaceIt script.
	That was smooth!

	* SDL_rotozoom.c, SDL_rotozoom.h, ship.c, vars.h:
	ShowDeckMap ceased to crash now, but still does not work correctly.
	Therefore I added the zoom tools to prepare the function.

	* defs.h, proto.h, ship.c, ship.h, text.c, view.c:
	GreatDruidShow is working acceptably well again.

	* init.c, ship.c, struct.h, text.c, view.c:
	Console droid images are displayed correctly again.
	The console now uses the jpg images found on a paradroid homepage directly.
	Old small bmp images have been replaced accordingly.

	* defs.h, ship.c:
	Dropped the palette rotation in console.
	Different images are used instead.

	* ship.c, takeover.c, vars.h, bullet.c, defs.h, init.c, main.c,
	misc.c, proto.h, rahmen.c: 
	Reactivated bullet-bullet collisions, now distance-based instead of pixel-based
	as with old grafix engine.

	* defs.h, global.h, graphics.c, init.c, keyboard.c, main.c,
	misc.c, proto.h, rahmen.c, ship.c, takeover.c, vars.h, view.c: 
	Improved the rahmen handling:  Updated are only done if needed, which is
	determined internally.
	NEW: DisplayRahmen now also does the text in the 'rahmen'.  It should
	     no longer be needed to call SetInfoline directly.  That should be
	     incorporated into the DisplayRahmen function.

	* text.c, vars.h, view.c, defs.h, graphics.c, init.c, main.c,
	misc.c, proto.h, rahmen.c, ship.c, takeover.c: 
	updated the ship graphics to new size.
	Made the scrolltext function finally work well.
	Removed some old engine code from here and there.
	Startet to modify the structure of DisplayRahmen.

2002-05-24  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* blocks.c, defs.h, graphics.c, init.c, misc.c, proto.h, ship.c,
	takeover.c, text.c: 
	Restored ScrollText to former glory.
	Activated DisplayImage(char * filename).
	Reactivated Title image.

	* defs.h, init.c, main.c, misc.c, ship.c, text.c:
	Reactivated the title signation and ClearUserFenster.

	* defs.h:
	Acivated "NEW_ENGINE" definition by default in defs.h.

	* defs.h, main.c:
	Updated my task chart.

	* defs.h, graphics.c, main.c, misc.c, proto.h, view.c:
	AssembleCombatWindow now accepts some FLAGS which are very convenient,
	especially inside Menu functions and all that.
	Take a look to inspect them.
	The main loop and other loops have been shortend accordingly.

	* misc.c, proto.h, view.c:
	Restored the escape menu.  Needs still some work.

2002-05-23  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am:
	o) first step towards proper "install" target: automake-structure is
	now better and will install map/ sound/ and graphics/ subdirs under
	$(pkgdatadir)/freedroid/  , where the default for $pkgdatadir=/usr/local.
	Remains to take account of that in the paths in the code...

	o) added check for libpthread _before_ libSDL, as some installations
	of SDL seem to depend on the posix-thread library!

2002-05-23  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* defs.h, graphics.c, misc.c, proto.h, rahmen.c, view.c:
	Reactivated the Escape Menu.  Submenus still need work.  Rahmen font fine now.

	* text.c, defs.h, graphics.c, rahmen.c, blocks.c:
	Set the rahmen to the new size.
	Now we let X resp. SDL decide about the best video mode:  works well!
	Adapted the size of digits inside droids.
	Added some files that are also used in the homepage.

	* blocks.c, init.c:
	Addepted software-sided to the new 2 pixel inter-block-distance.
	Wow, that was easy! 

	* defs.h, init.c, svgaemu.c, view.c:
	Upgraded code to use 64x64 pixel pixmaps.

	* blocks.c, global.h, graphics.c, influ.c, init.c, main.c, misc.c,
	takeover.c, view.c: 
	Started deletion of old engine from the code.
	Set default window size to 640x480.
	Activated time-wasting scaling EVERY frame, which is bad, but
	shows some interesting alpha effect. 

2002-05-22  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* play_then_kill_yiff:
	not used any more since yiff has been kicked out!

2002-05-22  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* init.c:
	Updated my TASK_CHART section and resolved conflicts.

2002-05-22  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* takeover.c:
	better user-input handling in takeover game allows higher precision
	in setting capsules.
	-> Pseudo "Key-repeat" sets in after some wait-cycles only, allows better
	single-steps

2002-05-21  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sound.c:
	corrected bug with SDL_mixer checking: I had put tests before
	inclusion of <config.h>, which doesn't make much sense...

	* system.h:
	conditional inclusion of <SDL/SDL_mixer.h> only when found by configure!

	* sound.c:
	conditional compilation now takes accound of configure-defines:
	HAVE_LIBSDL_MIXER and HAVE_SDL_SDL_H. If either is missing, sound
	is "dummy-compiled", everything should work ok!.

	* init.c:
	reactivated loading of Title-picture in Old engine

	* text.c:
	fixed bug in Initial Scroll-text: Text-screen is cleared before
	scrolling to avoid "smearing"

	* main.c:
	default value for global joy_sensitivity = 1.

	* keyboard.c:
	added Joystick-event reading in keyboard_update(): joystick motion is
	simply mapped to Motion-keys and Space.

	* joy.c:
	complete Joystick initialisation in Init_Joy().

	* init.c:
	added new switch [-j|--sensitivity=<n>] that changes analog-joystick
	sensitivity in the range [0,32].

	* global.h:
	added global joystick variables relating to joy.c

	* enemy.c:
	fixed (release-critical) bug in MoveEnemys() that produced
	endless-loop if enemy was put on a waypoint with _zero_ connections.

2002-05-21  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sound.c, text.c, graphics.c, main.c, misc.c:
	Sound can now really be completely turned of via command line,
	which was incomplete. 
	Corrected the bug in the scrolling text at the beginning.  Seems releasable.

	* defs.h, graphics.c, influ.c, misc.c, svgaemu.c:
	Corrected out some damage done to the old engine while introducing new fonts.
	Reactivated palette color operations, which cuts down FPS to about 65 but
	Influs color is now always correct.

	* init.c, main.c, rahmen.c, text.c, global.h, graphics.c:
	Paradroid font funktioniert wieder, wenn auch noch nicht besonders schoen.

2002-05-20  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* blocks.c, defs.h, global.h, graphics.c, proto.h, rahmen.c, view.c:
	Rahmen is displayed again, although without font.

	* blocks.c, defs.h, global.h, graphics.c, init.c, proto.h, ship.c,
	text.c, view.c: 
	the numbers in influ and enemy droid are now visible again.

	* defs.h, ship.c, svgaemu.c:
	Elevator picture now visible again.

	* view.c:
	Blasts are visible again.  dirty Blast-Bullet collision check disabled.

	* view.c:
	Bullets are visible again, but bullet-bullet-collision checking remains disabled.

	* view.c:
	Influencer is now visible again with the ne, but numbers are still omittet for now.

	* defs.h, view.c:
	Enemys are visible again, although the numbers are omittet for now.

	* view.c:
	Background scrolling works fully now!
	The procedure is very abstract and very powerful in my opinion!
	All of the clipping is done via SDL and its clipping capabilities.
	I hope the SDL knows what to do and their code is really bugfree!!!
	But it seems so.

	* misc.c, view.c:
	Map now visible again with the new engine.  Movement and enemys and that
	also runs well since there were no changes to this part.

	* graphics.c, main.c, map.c, proto.h, view.c:
	Renamed GetInternFenster into Assemble_Combat_Picture, which will do the
	assembling of the screen, but not into some internal window but rather into
	the ne_screen.  PutInternFenster will be a dumb return and updating of the
	screen can be done via SDL_Flip later.

	* graphics.c, init.c, rahmen.c:
	Added some more conditional compilations for the new engine.
	Deactivated the termination after InitPicutres.

2002-05-20  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* init.c, struct.h, takeover.c, vars.h, blocks.c, defs.h, global.h, graphics.c:
	continued work on NEW_ENGINE: InitPictures now loads in some blocks
	into SDL_Surface ne_blocks, using ne_get_blocks() that returns a
	SDL_Rect array with the block-positions.
	Old and new engine still compile and run ok.. well the new one doesnt
	actually do much though.. ;)

	* Makefile.am:
	included joy.c in files to compile

	* joy.c, proto.h:
	added for Joystic/Gamepad code, has only Init_Joy() at the moment
	(and doesnt detect my USB Logitech Gamepad yet! ;)

2002-05-20  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* bullet.c, init.c, main.c, misc.c, proto.h, sound.c, struct.h, view.c:
	Removed more bugs from the TODO buglist.

	* defs.h, enemy.c, global.h, influ.c, init.c, misc.c, struct.h,
	svgaemu.c, vars.h: 
	Corrected the way PermanentHealRobots treats droid:  Now the framerate is
	taken into account.  Also adapted some associated constants.

	* misc.c, proto.h, sound.c, system.h, defs.h, main.c:
	I have thrown out all yiff code.  rp now can also remove the checks for
	yiffs libraries and the linking of yiffs libraries, hoho.

2002-05-19  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sound.c:
	The sound FX and BG music volume can now be conveniently set via the escape menu.
	The game also does not terminate any more even when there is real
	shortage of free channels. 
	Is it time to dump the yiff?  It seems so.

	* bullet.c, view.c:
	Moved stupid flash-damage-handling from PutBullet to CheckBulletCollision,
	where the rest of the bullet-collisions and bullet-damage is handled.
	Corrected the way full sound buffers are treated by Freedroid:  Full buffers
	will now not lead to termination of the program although warning messages
	are generated.

	* blocks.c, sound.c, view.c:
	Reactivated ConceptView.  Very handy for overview about level and RecFlashFill!

	* sound.c:
	Sound effects are now also played successfully by the SDL MIXER library.
	Error checking, handling and prevention could still need improvement however.

	* sound.c:
	All background music files are now loaded and played successfully via
	the SDL_MIXER sound library.  Cool!

	* sound.c:
	SDL_Mixer is now successfully playing the background music!  Hurray!!
	At least on my system.  (rp must add -lSDL_mixer as linker option in general.)

	* graphics.c, init.c, proto.h, sound.c, system.h:
	In addition to new? video initialisation via Init_Video() now audio
	initialisation is done via Init_Audio() in a similar fashion, nice and
	clean for the caller in init.c.  All conditionals are handled inside.

	* defs.h, graphics.c, init.c, misc.c, proto.h, sound.c:
	Started transfer to SDL_AUDIO instead of the YIFF.
	Variable USE_SDL_AUDIO controls the use of YIFF or NON-YIFF.

	* influ.c:
	Influcolor palette manupilations every frame turned off now by default.

	* graphics.c, keyboard.c, misc.c, sound.c:
	Removed the initialisation of SDL_TIMER, so that yiff can be started again.

	* graphics.c, influ.c, misc.c:
	Removed calls to svgalib dummy functions removed by rp before.

2002-05-19  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* misc.c, proto.h, ship.c, svgaemu.c, text.c, vars.h, view.c,
	map.c, keyboard.c, main.c, blocks.c, bullet.c, colodefs.h, defs.h,
	global.h, graphics.c, init.c: 
	mainly started writing new engine, aktivated by #define NEW_ENGINE.
	Old Code runs ok, new code compiles but doesnt work yet...

2002-05-19  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* influ.c, keyboard.c:
	Resolved the strange WEAPON-mode--framerate-bug:  Influ color is now not
	set every frame which gives us DOUBLE FRAMERATE!! cool, isn't it?

	* influ.c, sound.c:
	Added extensive error docu and error explanation if there ever should be
	a problem with the yiff and how to resolve it.  This was a "release-critical"
	bug, that I consider now fixed.  Tell me if you are of different oppinion...

	* defs.h, influ.c, main.c, ship.c:
	Added framerate computation via SDL.  Gives very much the same results as
	the old code using gettimeofday.  A switch USE_SDL_FRAMERATE has been added
	in defs.h to allow for convenient switching between the two methods.

	* defs.h, global.h, graphics.c, keyboard.c:
	Removed a nonexisting picture from the code.

2002-05-18  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sound.c:
	More updates to the sound files.

	* sound.c: Cleaned up sound files...

	* sound.c: Deleted unused sound files.

	* sound.c:
	cleaned up more sound files...

	* sound.c:
	further restructurated sound files...

	* sound.c: Cleaned up sounds some more.

	* sound.c:
	Changed some sound files and removed obsolete sounds.

	* defs.h:
	Removed another obsolete graphic.

	* misc.c, text.c, main.c:
	Removed?? the "GetChar" bug?  Remove an obsolete graphic.

	* ship.c:
	removed some obsolete graphics.  Console looks now quite clean to me.

	* ship.c:
	Removed some obsolte graphics.  Modified console a little.

	* keyboard.c:
	Mainly updated the Homepage and added cleaned-up screenshots. (one less ;-) )

2002-05-17  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am:
	included maped.h, for distribution and dependencies

	* oldcode.c: shouldn't really be in CVS.
	!! * If you want it, please keep a local copy * !!
	i.e. rename it _before_ you do cvs update !!
	(otherwise check out the previous revision with cvs update -r<rev>

	* text.c, view.c:
	mainly cleanup and reduced used of Real/Internal Screen.

	* takeover.c:
	- new Infoline-treatment (SetInfoline(r,l))
	- greatly reduced use of obsolete Real/InternalScreen variables
	  instead of Outline320x200. (Only remains are in GetTakeoverGraphics())

	* svgaemu.c:
	- some "clean-up" (removed some DebugPrintf's)
	- some formatting to make it more readable

	* ship.c:
	- New Info-line handling (SetInfoline(l,r))
	- reduced use of Real/InternalScreen in favor of Outline320x200.
	- some clean-up

	* proto.h:
	Infoline-handling now down solely by SetInfoline(left,right)

	* map.c:
	uncommented un-defined use of EditTextInfo which only worked in -O2
	compilation.

	* main.c:
	mainly cleanup, plus take account of new Infoline-handling via SetInfoline(l,r).

	* keyboard.c:
	made deprecated KillTastaturPuffer() complain about being obsolete when called.

	* init.c:
	Re-activated printing of PACKAGE and VERSION when command-line option
	[-v|--version] is given. This should now even work on obsolete
	build-environements  (-> jp ;)

	* graphics.c:
	some cleanup, and SwapScreen() and WaitVRetrace() are deprecated and
	will complain about being obsolete when called ;)

	* global.h:
	some cleanup, and junked now obsolete LeftInfo[50], and RightInfo[]
	globals.

	* defs.h:
	added Infoline-defines from rahmen.h into here, because some are
	needed in global.h.

	* rahmen.c:
	All infoline-functions have now been reduced to only one:
	(replacing SayLeftInfo(), SayRightInfo() and UpdateInfoline())
	SetInfoline (char *left, char *right), which is given the
	strings  left,right to be displayed in the Infoline.
	When NULL is passed, this displays the defaults i.e. Me.status left
	and Score right.
	NOTE1: this function only acts on Outline320x200 and does not update
	the actual screen, so you have to call PrepareScaledSurface(TRUE) later.
	NOTE2: DisplayRahmen() now just does that, no Infoline is added and
	      the actualy screen is not updated either.

	* maped.h: added Copyleft to maped.h

	* maped.h:
	removed all the nasty ^M 's at the line-endings...

2002-05-17  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* influ.c, init.c, takeover.c:
	Cleaned the Rahmen during the Takeover game (that was easy, haha)

	* global.h:
	Changed Highes/Lowest/Greatscore data type to float, like RealScore is.
	This seems to have removed the "GetChar"-bug in Debriefing!

	* main.c, proto.h, ship.c, text.c:
	Cleaned up Console:  Its now really working well.
	Cleaned up the font colors in Debriefing.  Seems a little bit better this way.

	* maped.h:
	Forgot to add the (slighly modified, but otherwise old) maped.h too :-)

	* map.c, misc.c, proto.h:
	Added Save function to the level editor (now working completly correct,
	but also not crashing).

2002-05-16  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* colodefs.h, init.c, main.c, oldcode.c, proto.h, rahmen.c,
	ship.c, ship.h, text.c: 
	Cleaned up the Rahmen and the console.  Not flawless, but rather clean now.

	* keyboard.c, main.c, proto.h:
	The cheat menu is now hid a little bit better:  The new key to enter is
	SHIFT-CTRL-ALT-C.  I hope thats enough.  We could also demand left AND right
	shift and control and alt keys to be pressed, but for now I think its ok.

	* influ.c, oldcode.c, struct.h:
	Ahhhh, I finally managed to cleanly correct the bug that sometime
	boxed you around, sometimes even threw you out of the ship.  At
	least on my machine is works fine now. 

	* keyboard.c, misc.c, proto.h:
	Added better keyboard handling and even more level editor functionality.

	* defs.h, keyboard.c, map.h, misc.c, proto.h:
	Added more level editor functionality.

2002-05-16  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am, graphics.c, init.c, main.c, proto.h, rahmen.c, ship.c, text.c:
	changed #includes and Makefile acccording to renaming:
	para.c        -> main.c
	paratext.[ch] -> text.[ch]
	paravars.h    -> vars.h
	parainit.c    -> init.c

	* text.h:
	renamed "text.h" from "paratext.h"

	* global.h:
	taken account of new _file_ext  #defines due to renaming of para.c,
	paratext.c, paravars.h, parainit.c

	* text.c:
	renamed "text.c" from "paratext.c"

	* init.c:
	renamed to "init.c" from "parainit.c"

	* main.c: renamed "main.c" from "para.c"

	* paravars.h: * Renamed to "vars.h" !!

	* paratext.h, text.h:
	* Renamed to "text.h" !!

	* paratext.c: * Renamed to "text.c" !!

	* parainit.c: * Renamed to "init.c" !!

	* para.c: * Renamed to "main.c" !!

2002-05-16  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* misc.c:
	Started Level editor, invokable via Options/Escape Menu.

	* svgaemu.c, global.h, init.c, main.c, misc.c, oldcode.c, para.c,
	parainit.c, paratext.c, proto.h, sound.c, text.c: 
	Further completed the options menu.
	Cleaned up some sound code.

2002-05-15  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* main.c, misc.c, para.c, paratext.c, system.h, takeover.c, text.c:
	improved GetString() somewhat.

2002-05-15  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* init.c, main.c, para.c, parainit.c, sound.c:
	Added TODO stuff.
	Sound effect volume adjustment now completely operational.

2002-05-15  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* init.c, parainit.c, takeover.c:
	takeover game now runs at constant timing-speed... ouff

2002-05-15  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* global.h, init.c, misc.c, parainit.c, proto.h, sound.c, svgaemu.c:
	Added gamma corrections for to options menu.
	Added background volume adjustment to the options menu.
	Added full screen toggle to the options menu.
	Added Mission instructions to the single player menu.
	Added Framerate display option to the options menu.

	* proto.h, main.c, misc.c, para.c:
	Enlarged the options menu.

2002-05-15  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* misc.c:
	fixed jp's bug in "stuck" options menu: Have to set Weiter=TRUE to get
	out of it!! ;-)

	* global.h, graphics.c, init.c, main.c, misc.c, para.c,
	parainit.c, proto.h, ship.c, takeover.c, takeover.h: 
	-minor cleanup: remove obsolete InterruptInfolineUpdate,
		Monitorsignalunterbrechung(), NOJUNKWHILEINIT, MODSCHASEIN,
		+ several useless DebugPrintfs()

	- started proper timing control in Takeover game, only implemented
		yet for Color-choosing sequence.

	* system.h:
	*@argh!! forgot to bloody check the bloody file in, dammit!

2002-05-15  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* BFont.c, BFont.h, graphics.c, main.c, misc.c, para.c, proto.h, view.c:
	Extendes the options menu.  The problem of "stuck" escape key persists and
	remains not understood by me.

2002-05-14  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* keyboard.c, main.c, para.c:
	fixed bug in getchar_raw () that could cause "stuck keys"
	slightly modified Pause-function, leaving now always via "Space"

	* added BFont.c and BFont.h to Makefile.am
	system-wide includes are now all in "system.h"
	SDL-headers now included as <SDL/SDL.h>, to allow installation-path indep.
	Project name now more consistently "Freedroid" rather than "FreeDroid".

2002-05-14  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* BFont.c, BFont.h, global.h, graphics.c, init.c, main.c, misc.c,
	para.c, parainit.c, paratext.c, proto.h, ship.c, svgaemu.c,
	takeover.c, text.c, view.c: 
	Options menu is now based on great new fonts and therefore MUCH more flexible
	than the old structure that used one fixed image for the menu.

2002-05-14  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ship.c:
	properly wait for Space Press/Release at Deck-view in Console.

	* bullet.c:
	included <stdlib.h> for abs()

	* blocks.c, enemy.c, ship.c, svgaemu.c, takeover.c:
	minor modifs: - some cleanup, e.g. line-breaks in comment-blocks
		      - removed some (now) useless DebugPrintf()'s, now
			deprecated  as we can properly debug with gdb.

	* view.c:
	include <string.h> for memset() and memcopy() functions

	* proto.h:
	Flimmern() now takes an argument, GetString() now has 2. Added getchar_raw().

	* paratext.c, text.c:
	_completely_ rewritten GetString() (and hope nobody has seen the
	old code... lol ;).
	GetString now has _2_ arguments: MaxLen, and echo. The new argument
	"echo" switches between no echo (echo=0), printf-echo (echo=1) and
	SDL DisplayText (echo=2).
	I'm afraid there might be a bug somewhere in there, as Debriefing()
	now sometimes SegFaults, using this new functions. I'm working on it!

	* init.c, parainit.c:
	escaped multi-line string constants, as gcc-3.0 doesn't like them
	unescaped any more.

	* main.c, para.c:
	- adapted Pause() and ShowHighscoreList() to use the new
	getchar_raw() and generally SDL.
	- minor modifs mainly for consistency with my other global modifs, i.e.
	 use_fullscreen -> fullscreen_on, second argument to GetSting() in
	 Debriefing, ...

	* misc.c:
	adapted Cheatmenu() to SDL_ libs: output is now done simply via
	printf(), which shows the Cheat-menu in the text-window, while
	keyboard input is done vie getchar_raw() using SDL. This should be
	quite ok for a cheat-menu, which is intended for developers, not for
	users anyway... ;)

	This should now be 99% functional, please add/remove functionalities
	as needed.

	* map.c:
	- fixed bug in GetCrew() that lead to "strange" 001 enemys and 5xx
	numbers on yellow deck etc.
	- Remove some (now) useless DebugPrintf's. Since SDL, we can actually
	use a proper debugger and should reduce the use of DebugPrintf to an
	absolute useful minimum.

	* graphics.c:
	choice of Flimmer-type is now passed as an argument to Flimmern(),
	which might be useless but at least gets rid of the #ifdef conditional
	compilation, and allows to try different ones before maybe chosing just one.

	* keyboard.c:
	added a new function, getchar_raw(), which allows to get the character
	of the _next_ key pressed in a similar way getchar() does, but working
	under the raw SDL keyboard mode. This is used in the new GetString()
	function, and should generally come quite handy, I hope.

	* global.h:
	changed global toggle "use_fullscreen" to canonical name "fullscreen_on".
	I recommand using this canonical form for future global toggles.!

	* TAGS:
	TAGS file should be produced locally, and by using the command
	make tags

2002-05-14  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* paratext.c, ship.c, svgaemu.c, takeover.c, text.c, view.c,
	blocks.c, graphics.c, keyboard.c, map.c, misc.c: 
	Erradicated the last real SVGALIB dependencies and includes.
	Added the link to SDL_Paradroid to the homepage.

2002-05-12  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* keyboard.c:
	Added a screenshoot function, that is accessible via the p key.
	I hope I didn't mess anything up, because the server says I modified
	EVERYTHING.  Lets see...

2002-05-11  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* init.c, main.c, para.c, parainit.c, ship.c:
	resolved some warnings about gettimeofday.

	* graphics.c, misc.c, oldcode.c, proto.h, rahmen.c, view.c:
	Removed all remaining putpixel calls from FreeDroid.

	* blocks.c, oldcode.c:
	putpixel(...)-calls entirely deleted from module blocks.c.

	* blocks.c, graphics.c, oldcode.c:
	Removed a bug in the new DisplayBlock routine that didn't display
	the elevtor picture. 

	* graphics.c, oldcode.c, svgaemu.c:
	Added an icon and a window title for FreeDroid.
	Also moved some unused but perhaps not yet useless code to the new module
	oldcode.c.  PLEASE DO NOT INCLUDE OR COMPILE OR LINK THIS FILE.  THANKS.

	* blocks.c, init.c, parainit.c, rahmen.c, svgaemu.c, view.c:
	Started a new way to assemble the internal picture before it is drawn to
	the screen:  Now picture assembling is done in program memory, not in an
	SDL screen called "screen".  The new working field is names
	"Outline320x200" cause its the outline of what we later want to bring to
	the screen and cause its size is 320x200.  putpixels should NEVER again
	occur this way, not even in svgaemu.c, where PrepareScaledWindow has been
	patched allready.

	* blocks.c, global.h, paratext.c, rahmen.c, text.c, view.c:
	Resolved some conflicts, where there were local variables "screen"
	logically conflicting with global variable "screen".
	Turned off RotateBulletColor() and voila, 30 FPS at least again.

2002-05-10  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* svgaemu.c:
	Improved the technical details of PrepareScaledSurface:  This saves about
	15% time for improved framerate.

2002-05-10  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TAGS: minor modifs

	* svgaemu.c:
	slightly changed the handling of the use_fullscreen toggle.

	* struct.h:
	extended struct ship with num_levels, num_lifts, num_lift_rows
	members, which replace the now obsolete LevelsOnShip

	* ship.h:
	we now reserve the following Palette ranges:
	190 (EL_BG_COLOR),
	191-220 (EL_FIRST_LEVEL_COLOR - EL_LAST_LEVEL_COLOR) for the
		MAX_LEVELS level-colors

	221-236 (EL_FIRST_ROW_COLOR-EL_LAST_ROW_COLOR) for the MAX_LIFTROWS
		lift-rows.

	This corresponds to the MAX_LEVELS=29 and MAX_LIFTROWS=15 settings in
	defs.h and we hope this will be sufficient for future ships...?!

	* ship.c:
	removed the "ship-puzzle", where we composed the ship-view by small
	blocks, which now greatly simplifies this piece of code.
	Activated correct coloring of lift-rows and levels, using the _new_
	Palette range reserved for this (see ship.h).

	* init.c, parainit.c:
	extended/replaced Johannes' command-line code (sorry ;), and added the
	new options [-f|--fullscreen] and [-w|--window], with corresponding
	help-message. We use the toggle "use_fullscreen" rather than
	"FullScreen_Requested_By_Player_Tired_of_Playing_in_Window"... (lol ;)

	+ Use of new ship-struct members.

	* main.c, para.c:
	set default value for use_fullscreen to FALSE (for easier debugging)

	* map.c:
	use now ship-defines MAX_LEVELS, MAX_LIFTS and MAX_LIFTROWS.

	* graphics.c:
	we now longer read the (now) obsolete ELevator-blocks, which were used
	to "puzzle" together the ship-view. Instead, the complete ship-picture
	is loaded. Coloring of levels and lift-rows is done via color-palette.

	* global.h: added use_fullscreen toggle.

	* defs.h:
	- new #defines MAX_LIFTS, MAX_LEVELS and MAX_LIFTROWS for upper
	limits of lifts (formerly known as 'elevators'), levels and lift-rows
	on any ship.
	- removed ALLLEVELS, MAX_LEVELS_ON_SHIP and ALLELEVATORS.

	The new defines are now used consistenly everywhere.

	* colodefs.h:
	removed EL_* (elevator) color-definitions, they now stand all in
	ship.h.

	* blocks.c:
	corrected bug in DisplayBlock(): source++ was _before_ putpixel
		(should came after it)

	* Makefile.am:
	new Makefile which includes svgaemu.c in order to allow
	compilation...

2002-05-09  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* graphics.c, init.c, main.c, para.c, parainit.c, takeover.c:
	Removed the delay command from Takeover function.  Still it is incredibpy slow!
	Removed the bug, that the -f command line option didn't work.

	* defs.h, graphics.c, init.c, keyboard.c, main.c, misc.c, para.c,
	parainit.c, svgaemu.c: 
	Added command line switch for fullscreen mode. (strange: only work
	in long form?) 	Removed the lag at the beginning of the game
	menioned by Reinhard. Added the new constand SCALE-FACTOR, that
	lets you decide between x2 and x3 magnification. 

	* graphics.c, ship.c:
	Deactivated the too slow unfading of levels after leaving the elevator.
	This will be good to avail annoyed players for the new X11 release
	to be coming soon. 

	* graphics.c, paratext.c, ship.c, text.c:
	Ported Konsole to new Scale-Structured X11.

	* graphics.c, keyboard.c, main.c, para.c, paratext.c, proto.h,
	svgaemu.c, text.c, view.c: 
	Portet SetUserfenster, GetString and the Debriefing and the
	Flimmern function to X11. 
	A lot of new keys are now accessible via the usual ?Pressed() functions.

	* graphics.c, init.c, parainit.c, paratext.c, svgaemu.c, text.c:
	Added comments about BULLETCOLOR rotation to be removed sooner or later.

	* graphics.c, init.c, parainit.c, paratext.c, ship.c, svgaemu.c,
	takeover.c, text.c: 
	Takeover and Title screen are now visible again, hey that rhymes.

	* graphics.c, main.c, para.c, view.c:
	Corrected the color handling.  Patched the too low framerate-constant at the
	beginning.  Incorporated PrepareScaledSurface into PutInterFenster.

	* svgaemu.c:
	Forgot to add this last file for the transfer to X11.  Hope all is well...

	* paratext.c, proto.h, ship.c, text.c, view.c, blocks.c, defs.h,
	global.h, graphics.c, init.c, keyboard.c, main.c, map.c, misc.c,
	para.c, parainit.c: 
	The game now runs under X11 using the SDL. (Thats why the many changes.)

2002-05-09  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* view.c:
	mainly eliminated use of BeamLine in PutOject().
	introduced use of some new gl_  svgalib functions, although Johannes
	will throught them out immediately again... hope this will not cause
	too many conflicts...

	* takeover.c:
	ShowPlayground(): takeover game now uses "frame-buffering"
	(via InternalScreen) as well, for a smooth display.

	* init.c, parainit.c:
	-removed BeamLine, and added initialisation of Random-number generator
	  to make sure the game-beginning is really random too

	* misc.c:
	mainly re-written MyRandom(). This function is now tested to give equally
	probable integer numbers in the range [0, Obergrenze].

	* influ.c:
	removed use of global variable BeamLine

	* graphics.c: changed some comments.

	* global.h:
	removed useless (I hope ;) global variable BeamLine

	* enemy.c:
	- better waypoint-treatment should get rid of "ghost"-enemys going
	through walls to (0,0).

	- removed all reference and use of the global variable BeamLine, which
	  seemed rather useless... (I hope)

	* defs.h:
	added macros Grob2Fein(x) and Fein2Grob(x) for easier conversion between
	Fein<-->Grob coordinates.
	Note: for simplicity these macros can be used for x and y coords,
	as long as BLOCKHOEHE=BLOCKBREITE, which is ok for the moment, but might
	change in the future

	However, a new concept for these grob/fein coordinates might be necessary
	anyway, as it seems currently too specific to 320x200 resolution...

2002-05-08  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* influ.c, ship.c:
	Calibrated the effect of the refresh field:  more refreshment, same price.
	Cleared out the bug, that the status line remained dead after visition Consoles.

	* init.c, parainit.c:
	Filled the AUTHORS file with something sensible (like others did)
	Commented out the PACKAGE_STRING again.

2002-05-07  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* init.c, parainit.c:
	re-activated output of Version information with --version.
	Note: PACKAGE_STRING must be #defined in your config.h file. Make
	sure you re-run aclocal, autoheader, autoconf, automake if not. If
	this #define is still missing in your config.h, your gnu-build
	environement might be broken, or you have to update it... 

2002-05-07  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* init.c, main.c, para.c, parainit.c, rahmen.c, sound.c, view.c:
	Added more TitleText information, also about the controls of the game.
	There might, no there will, be people, who NEVER heard of paradroid.
	Removed the frame-rate-debug information that made the screen ugly.
	Remove a SegFault cause:  High-Score name freed after it is displayed!

2002-05-07  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* enemy.c, global.h, init.c, main.c, map.c, misc.c, para.c,
	parainit.c, takeover.c: 
	- some additions to Cheatmenu, in order to help track problems
	with map & "ghost robots".. 
	- added command-line option [--debug|-d[=LEVEL]] to switch on
	output of debug-messages (files currently gets *HUGE* very fast,
	so this should only be used when needed!)  debug-levels supported
	_in principle_, but only ON/OFF (i.e. 0, >0) implemented 
	- Takeover game now non-transparent by default (looks much better ;)

2002-05-06  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* init.c, main.c, misc.c, para.c, parainit.c, paratext.c, proto.h, text.c:
	Added improved check for nescessary line-feeds.  Now it is no longer nescessary
	to add a \n in any text to be displayed by DispalyText or
	ScrollText but the functions will do line breaking themselves.
	Removed all \n from Title Texts and Console Texts. This will be
	much more convenient when changes are made to the text and
	guessing the right time for a line feed can be omitted.  Added a
	missing letter in the fontpicture also. 

2002-05-05  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Started an EndTitle function that will be called as soon as all robots aboard
	the ship are dead.  (The armageddon-cheat-option is very convenient to achieve
	this.)  This new function also displays part of the new story line.

	* Corrected the SegFault bug that came from too little accocated memory for the
	text describing druids at the console, that faulted if 999 was displayed.
	Now that Bug should be fixed.

	* view.c:
	I activated a security check:  PutEnemy now sets the type of the druid to 001
	whenever it encouters a druid with illegal type.  Please note,
	that this is only a dirty workaround and not a solution to the
	problem, which in my opinion is due to the DOS-TO-UNIX conversion
	problems of out ship- crew- and map-files, that cause some (the
	last or first most likely) entrys to contain junk.  However the
	SegFault bug for now disappears. 
	
	* Tracked a Segfault bug:  The cause seems to be a druid of type 33 where we
	know only 24 different druid types.  Asked Reinhard to correct the bug.
	Added a lot of additional debug messages and security checks in the process.

	* Added some new sounds and imroved the sound behaviour in takeover game.
	Also improved the flash behaviour, mainly the too short optical effect.

	* Calibrated one but one very important constant for framerate
	computation, that will staightens out the last time-distorting
	after longer delays.  The only other time-distortion can happen at
	the very first beginning of the game, where no data on the
	framerate to be expected is yet available.  I think that is
	tolerable. jp. 

2002-05-04  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Inproved collision behaviour:  multiple collisions (immediately
	destroying influ) should no longer occur.  Improved wait, firewait
	and aggression behaviour of druids. Seems pretty much like the
	original now, although I don't have the original game or even an
	emu installed. 

	* Since there were some unsmoothnesses in the flow of the game,
	that had to do 	with framerates and distorted framerates I
	corrected the flaw.  Apart from that there is now a function
	called Activate_Conservative_Frame_Computation(); that 	should be
	called whenever the game flow is stopped for possibly longer
	periods of time, e.g. in elevators, consoles, takeover, options
	menu, debug menu.  The 	new code seems to work pretty well, at
	least on my machine. 

	* Now different sounds for different bullet types are implemented.

	* Takeover game has now more sounds, although these sounds could
	perhaps use improvement. 

	* Corrected the bug, that the influ is in transfermode by default
	when coming out of the elevator, thereby often initiating
	unintended takeover of inferiour droids. 

	* Redid the TRANSFERCOUNTER code to make it frame_dependent (and useful again).

	* Further improved the official menu, that is accessible via ESCAPE key.

2002-05-03  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added a preliminary options menu, that is of course not fully
	functioning yet. The menu is accessible via the escape key.
	Since this is not some debug window, it is intended to be
	graphically impressive. 

2002-05-02  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* o) 'GNU-yfied' whole source by indent. Please try to stick to
	   these conventions too  (by imitation, or by using indent). Ok,
	   this is not compulory but it  makes reading the code easier.

	o) sound_on is now checked _by_ the sound-functions, not by the caller!
	   Yiff is unconditionally initialised: this allows switching on/off
	   of sound in real-time. Unfortunately this does not yet work for the
	   background music, maybe Johannes can implement something along these
	   lines..?
	o) can't remember what else I did, probably nothing important... ;)

2002-05-02  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sound.c:
	deleted more unused sound code.  improved debug logging a little bit more.

	* sound.c:
	added more doku to sound.c and remove some old unused code.

2002-05-01  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* o) changed all possible printf() statements into DebugPrintf()
	o) Transparent takeover game now works nicely, but is it really useful? :|

2002-05-01  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added more and better debugmessages for better tracking of the
	latest background music problem. However I am not sure I
	understand it yet.  I hope the new debugmessages help a bit. 

2002-05-01  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* takeover.c:
	fixed Bug in ShowPlayground() that caused a seg-fault when Takeover game
	was finished (sorry ;)

2002-05-01  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Set release nr. to 1 in configure.  Still had to comment the
	"PACKAGE_STRING" line out in parainit.c in order to have it
	compile.  Can someone else verify the crash related to sound?  I
	seem to be unable to reproduce the bug. 

2002-05-01  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* init.c, parainit.c:
	Version and Package name output by --version are now set by configure!
	Ideally the _only_ place to set version+name should be configure.ac .

	* takeover.c:
	o) added transparancy to takeover game (is not finished yet). I'm not sure
	  if that will be usefull, but one only has to do a SetUserfenster(color)
	  at the beginning to remove transparancy ...
	o) jp has slightly messed up the code when adding his sound-effect
	   this could not possibly have compiled like that??!!

	* map.c:
	fixed mini-bug in TranslateMap()  (NewBlock was not initialised)

	* defs.h:
	why not try the new title-picture? (at least it gives the right _name_!)

2002-05-01  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* More debug messages added, while trying to track a reproducable
	segfault bug. 

	* ship.c:
	Erredicated the bug in the GreatDruidShow keyboard controls.

	* Takeover game now has more sound.

	* Improved Background sounds:  More sound files + Background music
	can be switched easily. Takeover, Console, Title and Combat each
	have their own background music. 

	* Refreshes now rotate at a adecent speed AND also work at decent speed.
	Score is reduced in a moderate amount.
	Made some corrections to the "Rahmen":  It now is displayed sans
	red box around it. 

2002-04-30  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Corrected the bug, that was recently made into SetUserfenster,
	when rp ported the function.  Corrected the bug, that was in
	ClearUserFenster, where the order of parameters was mixed up,
	which made a setmem call useless. 

	* Refresh fields rotate now at the right speed.  (Their effect and
	scoredrain isn't fixed yet.) Corrected the bug of missing robot
	rotation after the influ has been defeated. 
	
2002-04-30  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ported the SetUserfenster() function in view.c to use vgalib.
	Takeover game now finished as far as the original version is concerned.

2002-04-29  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* bullet.c,
	view.c: 
	Robot blast damage now functioning correctly (same as influencer).
	Influencer takes the right amount of damage when hit by bullets.
	Improved Homepage a (little) bit. 

	* Corrected the version number in the title screen.
	Fixed the bug, that influencers damage from bullets was random.

	* Erradicated some (justified) warnings.  Adapted some
	robot-related constants. BTW, the autoconf/automake STILL does not
	produce -Wall switch for the makefile in /src. 

2002-04-28  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* blocks.c,
	takeover.c: 
	fixed small bug in DisplayMergeBlock(): source++ came _before_
	check on TRANSPARENTCOLOR resulting in display Problems in
	takeover-game. Takeover-game now well adjusted. Still lacking a
	uniform Color background. what function to use? 

2002-04-28  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Redid the somewhat flaky mathematics of enemy fire.  Enemy
	robots are now perfect marksmen. They always hit (allthough they
	do not consider current movement of the influencer but rather
	shoot at his current position).  They never hit themselves,
	although it can happen, that two bullets are fired to shortly
	after each other, colliding and creating a blast that can harm the
	enemy.  But that is seldom happening and also happening in the C64
	version, as far as I know.  Game fun is drastically increased with
	such enemys! Hoa! Cool!  See ya, jp. 

	* Cleaned up the console, especially the "GreatDruidShow".
	Allthough some minor flaws still exist, I find that it looks quite
	passable.  Come and see for yourself. 

	* Erased a stupid segfault due to unincluded headers due to
	insufficient compiler warnings! Please someone sooner or later see
	to that the autoconf/automake generated appropriate compiler 
	switches that cause maximal warnings!  Thanks,jp.

	* ship.c, view.c:
	All druidimages should now be displayed at the console.
	However, slight color distortions may still occur in some druidimages.
	They are only minor however and should disappear, when the graphics are
	worked over or if we set the vga palette separately.  Do that if
	you feel like it... 

	* Code added to read in the images of the druids for the console depiction.
	Modifications were made to the image files go get their properties right...
	Work is still left to do there.

	* Since Reinhards new DisplayMergeBlock function tended to segfault because of
	uninitialized pointers, I corrected the little mistake and also added some new
	function "DebugPrintf" that should be used throughout the code for debug-messages,
	CONSISTING ONLY OF ONE STRING, so that we can conveniently turn on and off the
	crowd of debug messages as desired with one little switch in
	misc.c.  Have fun, jp. 

	* sound.c:
	Added and activated GotHitSound produced by incoming bullets.

	* graphics.c:
	Portet the old "Flimmern" function to use svgalib calls instead of
	writing to memory. 

	* Redid some of the old unelegant sound code.  Its now much
	shorter, more elegant and new sounds can be added much easier than
	before.  Some new sounds added as well. 

2002-04-28  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Command line parsing now works. Currently implemented [-v | --version]
	[-? | -h | --help], [-q | --nosound ], [-s | --sound] (default),
	[-t | --timeout=SECONDS ] ... sets alarm - timeout for debug purposes.

	See the function parse_command_line() in parainit.c and "man getopt"
	if you want to add further functionality.

	* Takeover game now nearly perfect, uses only *our* graphics of to_elem.pcx
	(-> no copyright problems...). Background still needs to be cleared...

	* blocks.c:
	DisplayMergeBlock() now ported (in analogy to DisplayBlock())

2002-04-28  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Improved the sound a bit more....

2002-04-27  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Improved the sound a bit:  blasts and refreshes and elevators now
	produce sound! have fun. 

	* Added some new sounds.  Sound active as default.

2002-04-25  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sound.c:
	Sound working again!  Jiippiiiee!

2002-04-24  jprix  <johannesprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sound.c:
	Tried to correct the sound bug.  Had to do it blindly, for the
	project doesn't compile at my machine at the moment. 
	So, good luck everybody with the changes I made...

2002-04-22  rprix  <rprix@users.sourceforge.net>

	* nosound.c:
	nosound.c is redundant now, conditional compilation in sound.c

	* Makefile:
	Makefile is now _built_ by configure, should _not_ be checked in.

	* NEW Project NAME:  FreeDroid (aka freedroid-0.6.0).
	All c-files now include <config.h>, built from configure

	* sound.c:
	uses #if HAVE_LIBY2 from <config.h> to compile conditionally, depending on
	presence of Yiff-library as detected by configure.

	* Makefile.am:
	Main source-files of the GNU build environement.
	Run autoconf and automake to obtain the configure-script.
