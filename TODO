Bugs
=======

A lot of things need to be done.  There is a public TODO: a list of things,
that could be done by anyone interested in helping the project along, even
without knowing much about the internals of FreedroidRPG.

This list can be found in our WIKI.  Please look here:

http://freedroid.sourceforge.net/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/OpenJobs/OpenJobs

and click on the detailed jobs in the left bar.

Otherwise this file will not be maintained any longer, as the WIKI does do a
better job.  If you are interested, my private todo can also be found in the
Sourceforge Freedroid project page "tasks" section, but the stuff there would
require a bit more explaining and a bit more insight into the internals of the
game and maybe even a little programming... 

Thanks a lot and see ya, jp.
