*** START OF PURE SCROLLTEXT DATA ***
Congratulations!!

The disruptor shield is now being activated and the bots already started to wander off.  You have won the game.  A big celebration will be held in your honor at the guardian citadel of the colony and there will be happiness and joy for quite some time.  (At least until we've prepared a 'second act' of the game.)



If you liked FreedroidRPG and wish to contribute something to the development, that would be wonderful.  There are plenty of opportunities to do so.  Especially more content, i.e. 

* additional level design and level beautifications
* more quests and quest ideas and characters and character dialogs
* more items and character descriptions and item descriptions
* more individual descriptions for obstacles on the map to add extra depth to the game

would be very welcome, see also the credits section.
