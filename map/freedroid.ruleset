Feel free to make any modifications you like.  If you set up 
something cool, please send your file in to the Freedroid project.

You can edit it with a standard text editor of your choice.
Feel free to make any modifications you like.
Freedroid will still accept you modified game dada file as long
as you stick to the following rules:
1.) the text indicating the Start of the Robot Data Section must not
    be removed or changed.  It is needed by Freedroid in order to find
    the robot section in your modified file.
2.) the text indicating the end of the data file must not be removed.
    It is needed by Freedroid to ensure the integrity of this data file.
3.) Every new robot must begin with the typical "Start of new Robot"
    string AND the asterisks as you see in the existing robots.
    Best copy an existing robots data to a new location at the end
    of the robot data section and modify the values to your liking. 

YOU CAN INSERT EXTRA LINES WITH EXTRA TEXT anywhere you like in this file.
That will not cause any problems.
