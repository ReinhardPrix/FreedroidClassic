Mission diary entry="The doctor was easily fooled. I have the pills that Bender needs."
Mission diary entry="I nearly killed the doctor, but he gave me the antidote. I hope he has learned his 
lesson. They say that repetition is the mother of learning, but I don't think he can survive one more 
iteration of what I did to him. Ha. Ha. Ha."

be sentient. Life is precious and should be preserved."
Mission diary entry="The tunnels bots seem to be working together with Dixon in keeping the city working. 
All is well that ends well."
Mission diary entry="Finally. I am tired, covered in bruises and oil... But finally I made sure the bots 
will not survive. It felt great to break their metal bodies and crush their circuits. Dixon seemed not too 
happy about this solution, but I don't care. It was fun killing the bots. Nothing else matters."
Mission diary entry="I gave the toolkit to Dixon. He was very happy to have his autotools back. He gave 
me his helmet as a gift. I guess this is better than nothing."
