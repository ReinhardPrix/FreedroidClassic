--------------------------------------------------

The structure of a mission file is simple.
* There must be a starting string indicating the
  start of the real mission data.
* A mission name must be specified
* A mission briefing text must be specified
* A mission target must be specified.
* A "ship" must be specified, where a "ship" could also
  be for example a small automated mining community or
  a building complex somewhere on a planet.
* A crew file must be specified, where the information which
  droids are to be generated in which levels can be found.
* A "game.dat" file must be specified, containing all the
  droid specifications and the constants for the game
  physics.
* An elevator file must be specified.
* A missing file termination string should be present to indicate
  the end and the integrity of the mission file.

What all these strings must look like can easily deduced 
directly form the following example.

*** Start of Mission File ***

Mission Name: Invading Asteroid Command Central

+++
+++ At first we specify the other files, that also contain essential
+++ information about this mission, e.g. maps and droids and that

+++
+++ For the asteroid command central invasion mission, 
+++ there is also only one single starting point allowed,
+++ which is right outside the the scientists barricades:

Possible Start Point : Level=2 XPos=10 YPos=7


+++
+++ Now we define the mission target
+++ For the Outbreak mission, this target is defined as

* New Mission Briefing Text Subsection *
Now that you've successfully removed the droids assaulting the scientists retreat, they could shortly leave the bunker and get new parts required for the construction of the teleportation device.  It will still take some time, but when it is finally finished, it might allow to beam a unit or person away to some distant location, like on borad of the corvette, if luck is with us.  
But for now, there are more pessing matters:  Dr. Stone has received a call from some of his colleagues, who could not leave the quarter deck in time and had to hide from the battle droids, that search and eliminate any living being on the quarters deck.  You must go and put an end to this madness.  There will be only old 751 droids, but with the MS controlling them, they can be fierce killerbots.  Dr. Stone addresses you, that you please go and try to put an end to this madness and to save who you can, while the scientists will bandage their wounds and continue their work.

** Beginning of End Title Text Section **
Congratulations!!

It seems that you have made it!  The private quarters deck is cleared.  The last hiding scientists rush off either to join
the others working feverishly on the teleportation device, that shall sooner or later warp them out of this whole
misery or to bandage the wounds of those that were injured.  For an hour or so, the situation stays quiet.  Then again an alarm is set off.

Dr. Chandra turns to you to investigate the matter.
