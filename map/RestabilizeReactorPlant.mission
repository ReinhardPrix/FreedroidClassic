--------------------------------------------------

The structure of a mission file is simple.
* There must be a starting string indicating the
  start of the real mission data.
* A mission name must be specified
* A mission briefing text must be specified
* A mission target must be specified.
* A "ship" must be specified, where a "ship" could also
  be for example a small automated mining community or
  a building complex somewhere on a planet.
* A crew file must be specified, where the information which
  droids are to be generated in which levels can be found.
* A "game.dat" file must be specified, containing all the
  droid specifications and the constants for the game
  physics.
* An elevator file must be specified.
* A missing file termination string should be present to indicate
  the end and the integrity of the mission file.

What all these strings must look like can easily deduced 
directly form the following example.

*** Start of Mission File ***

Mission Name: Restabilize Reactor Plant

+++
+++ At first we specify the other files, that also contain essential
+++ information about this mission, e.g. maps and droids and that
+++
Physics ('game.dat') file to use for this mission: freedroid.ruleset
Ship file to use for this mission: Asteroid.maps
Lift file to use for this mission: RestabilizeReactorPlant.elevators
C**rew file to use for this mission: RestabilizeReactorPlant.droids
Crew file to use for this mission: none
Lifts On file to use for this mission: asteroid_on.png
Lifts Off file to use for this mission: asteroid_off.png
After completing this mission, load mission : Paradroid.mission

Influs mission start comment="Ok.  I'm on my way to that reactor room problem.";

+++
+++ For the asteroid command central invasion mission, 
+++ there is also only one single starting point allowed,
+++ which is right outside the the scientists barricades:
+++
Possible Start Point : Level=2 XPos=19 YPos=6


+++
+++ Now we define the mission target
+++ For the Outbreak mission, this target is defined as
+++ to eliminate all droids with the specified marker
+++ namely '1'.  Thats also quite simple.
+++
Mission target is to kill all droids : 1
Mission target is to kill class of droids : -1
Mission target is to kill droids with marker : -1
Mission target is to become class : -1
Mission target is to become type : -1
Mission target is to overtake a droid with marker : -1
Mission target is to reach level : -1
Mission target is to reach X-Pos : -1
Mission target is to reach Y-Pos : -1
Mission target is to live for how many seconds : -1

* New Mission Briefing Text Subsection *
After the battle droids on the quarters deck suddenly fell out, the MS head quarters has reacted and sent new instructions and a new plan to the corvette crew.  An alert is set off from the reactor room.
Since the scientists are all busy finishing the teleportation unit they are creating (and the reactor room of off limits to humans anyway) Dr. Chandra asked you to investigate the matter.  They do not know the exact cause of the problem, but you will find out anyway they are sure.

** Beginning of End Title Text Section **
Congratulations!!

You have managed to clear the reactor room from the MS saboteur bot and it's guard of security droids!  With full access tot the reactor controls, Newton was able to restore the reactor to normal operations within a few moments.  The situation seems to be under control again.  The scientists in the meantime seem to be preparing everything for a major teleportation transport but do not tell you much about it yet...

SORRY, BUT AT THIS POINT, THE THREAD OF ACTION IS INTERUPTED.
WE HAVE NOT YET HAD THE TIME TO CREATE MORE STORY AND MORE
MISSION FILES.  THAT MIGHT CHANGE SOON.  STAY TUNED.....

For now you will be redirected to the classical paradroid
mission.  Sorry.

Press Fire to move on to the classical paradroid mission
