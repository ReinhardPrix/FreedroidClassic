Oh Tux, finally you have returned!  You've come to save us, havn't you?  You must know that earlier, I was on the MS prefered person list as well.  But when they finally requested all their preferred persons be fitted with implants, that would allow them to upload any software directly to my brain any time they wanted, it became too much even for me and I fled to this refuge.  It's good that I have found new friends and I hope we can make it together.
