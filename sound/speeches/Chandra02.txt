Tux!  At last you have returned as I knew you would!  Alas, this is an hour of dire need indeed.  The MS forces have killed may of us immediately at the day of the revolution and others who resisted were taken away to become subjects in the experiments of the MS.  You must invade their cental and try to save who you can!  If you take the teleporter, it will take you directly to the first level of their main installation.  Perhaps you can rescue some of you friends held captive there.
