Beware, Tux, when I finally made my escape from the second level, I saw a dark sales apprentice of the MS, transformed into a vile half-human creature, now lurking mindlessly for blood.  Take care if you encounter this one.  He has taken the lives of many of my friends.  You must go and put a end to the thing so that further evil is prevented and the things soul may finally rest.
